Instruction = Q
End of one unit of time.
Command = 'S 1000'
Set the value of the integer variable to 1000.
cpu.value: 0 -> 1000
No ready processes, so continue to run the current process.

Instruction = Q
End of one unit of time.
Command = 'A 19'
Add 19 to the value of the integer variable.
cpu.value: 1000 -> 1019
No ready processes, so continue to run the current process.

> Q
Instruction = Q
End of one unit of time.
Command = 'F 1'
Create 1 new simulated process(es).
Created a process(pid=1).
Quantum was expired, so assign the first process in the que to CPU.
Pid(0)'s priority class was raised to 1.
New process was assigned to CPU.
Swithed: cpu(0) <--> pid(1)
